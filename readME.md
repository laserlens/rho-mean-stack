# Goal
## Update Mongo Fields
1. Add a hometown field to our input form.
2. Add a favorite movie field to the input form.
- Make sure these fields are carried through to the Mongoose Schema/Model and the Mongo database. Show these new fields on the DOM.

## Hard Mode
1. Sort it! Implement a select drop-down on the DOM to change the order of the ng-repeat for the title field.

## Pro Mode
1. Use Bootstrap, Skeleton, or another similar framework to style the app.
